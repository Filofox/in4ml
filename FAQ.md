# Frequently-asked questions #

Well..OK no-one's asked any of these questions -- it's really just a bunch of sort-of-relevant things I wanted to say somewhere.

## Why 'in4ml'? ##

It's pronounced 'informal' (in **form** al...geddit?). I needed a short, unique, easy-to-remember name, and PHP doesn't like class names that begin with numbers so I couldn't use '4ml' like I wanted to.

## How did the project come about? ##

Long story short: several years ago I developed a similar system as part of a much larger project. Over time I adapted it for use in other projects but as a result of its rather haphazard development span it ended up sprawling, over-complicated and unwieldy. So I decided to start it again from scratch, and make it open source at the same time.

## I don't like (something about in4ml), are there any alternatives? ##

Well if there's something you think could be done better, then please feel free to contact me and I'll let you know whether or not it's likely to happen.

If you really think you need an alternative then right here on Google Code there's a very similar project called [ValidForm Builder](http://code.google.com/p/validformbuilder/). I've never tried it but it looks pretty decent. I'm sure there are others, if you'd like me to put a link here then just drop me a line and I'll add it.
